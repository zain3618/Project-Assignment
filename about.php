    <h2> Who we are? </h2>

        <p> CookFest.com began in 2018. We were University Undergraduates , we realized that it was pretty frustrating for the average kid or adult to find a decent Proper CookBook.
            It was not easy to manage and find everything (i.e a Video tutorial, Recipe, Most of the dishes), It was time consuming, and expensive to manage. </p>

    <h2> Why are we doing this? </h2>
        <p> We created the CookFest.com an Online Cookbook with the user's perspective in mind.
            We wanted to offer a platform that would be user friendly and only requires basic/moderate cooking skills or experience.
            We keep it simple, so users can focus on making some mouth watering food that reflects a 5 star-brand.
            Best of all - everything is free for access. You can get online, checkout the recipes, or watch a video right away.</p>

    <h2> What makes us different? </h2>
        <p> From getting more comfortable in the kitchen to mastering new shortcuts and cuisines,
            youâ€™ll find yourself learning, advancing, and looking forward to cooking more and living better.
            Our Site is the best when it comes to breaking down complex recipes into just a few simple steps while keeping that five-star look and taste alive.</p>
