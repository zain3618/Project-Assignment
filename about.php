    <h2> Who we are? </h2>

        <p> CookFest.com began in 2018. We were University Undergraduates , we realized that it was pretty frustrating for the average kid or adult to find a decent Proper CookBook.
            It was not easy to manage and find everything (i.e a Video tutorial, Recipe, Most of the dishes), It was time consuming, and expensive to manage. </p>

    <h2> Why are we doing this? </h2>
        <p> We created the CookFest.com an Online Cookbook with the user's perspective in mind.
            We wanted to offer a platform that would be user friendly and only requires basic/moderate cooking skills or experience.
            We keep it simple, so users can focus on making some mouth watering food that reflects a 5 star-brand.
            Best of all - everything is free for access. You can get online, checkout the recipes, or watch a video right away.</p>

    <h2> What makes us different? </h2>
        <p> From getting more comfortable in the kitchen to mastering new shortcuts and cuisines,
            you’ll find yourself learning, advancing, and looking forward to cooking more and living better.
            Our Site is the best when it comes to breaking down complex recipes into just a few simple steps while keeping that five-star look and taste alive.</p>
